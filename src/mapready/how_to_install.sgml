    <title>Obtaining and Installing the Tool</title>
    <para>The latest version can be downloaded from the ASF web
       site at http://www.asf.alaska.edu.
    </para>
    <para>How you install the tool depends on which operating system
       you are using. Windows packages come with an installer, Linux
       packages come as an RPM, and Source packages contain source
       code with an autoconf-style configure script.</para>

    <sect1 id="Windows">
      <title>Windows Installation</title>
      <para>The Windows package contains just a single file, the
        installer.</para>
      <para>To install, you open the archive file that
        you downloaded (double-clicking on it will open it); then
        run the installer program contained within.</para>
      <para>After installation, you will have a start-menu group
        called "ASF Tools", and inside that another program group
        called "MapReady 2.0".  Inside that group, "ASF MapReady" is
        the main program (formerly known as "Convert").</para>
      <para>The "MapReady 2.0" start menu group also contains a link to the
        ASF MapReady Manual, an extensive document that describes
        all of the installed programs and contains examples of their use.</para>
      <para>Also installed: ASF View (a viewer application which can display
        CEOS format data, as well as GeoTIFFs, ASF Internal Format files, etc.),
        the CEOS Metadata Viewer, and the Projection Coordinate Conveter. 
      </para>
      <para>By default, the installer also creates desktop icons for MapReady
        and ASF View.</para>
    </sect1>


    <sect1 id="Linux">
      <title>Linux Installation</title>
      <para>To install the RPM, you must have root access. If you
        do not, you will need your system administrator to install
        the package for you. If this is not feasible, the Source
        package can instead downloaded, compiled, and installed
        in your own home directory which does not require root
        privileges.</para>
      <para>To install the package:</para>
      <para>First extract the rpm from the archive:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>gunzip mapready-X.X.X-linux.tar.gz</member>
        <member>tar xvf mapready-X.X.X-linux.tar</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>Then, as root, install the rpm:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>rpm -i asf_mapready-X.X.X-1.i386.rpm</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>(Of course you need to replace the X's with whatever
        version you downloaded, for example:
        "rpm -i asf_mapready-2.0.5-1.i386.rpm")
      </para>
      <para>After the package is installed, you can find out where
        individual compenents were put by using this rpm command,
        which does not require root access:</para>
      <simplelist><member>rpm -ql asf_mapready | grep asf_import</member></simplelist>
      <para>You should see something like the following:</para>
      <simplelist><member>/usr/local/bin/asf_import</member></simplelist>
      <para>which tells you that the package has been installed in
        /usr/local, which is the default.</para>
      <para>This directory needs to be added to your path, in order to
        run the tools. Exactly how you do this depends on which UNIX
        shell you are using.</para>
      <para>For example, suppose the software was installed in
        /opt/asf_tools.  For sh, ksh, bash, or the like, add these lines
	to your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>PATH=/opt/asf_tools/bin:$PATH</member>
        <member>export PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>For csh or tcsh, add this line to your ~/.cshrc file:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>setenv PATH /opt/asf_tools/bin:$PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>If you've gone with the default installation location of
        /usr/local, you may already have /usr/local/bin in your path,
        in which case you don't need to do anything.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Source">
      <title>Source Installation</title>
      <para>After you've downloaded the archive, you need to extract
      the package and compile the tools before they can be installed.
      To do this, make sure you're in the directory where the archive
      was downloaded to and:</para>
      <para>First extract the directory tree from the archive:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>gunzip mapready-X.X.X-src.tar.gz</member>
        <member>tar xvf mapready-X.X.X-src.tar</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>Then build the tools. Please note that you will need
      permissions to put files into [[installation location]]! The
      default is /usr/local.</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>cd asf_tools</member>
        <member>./configure --prefix=[[installation location]]</member>
        <member>make</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>Next install them:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>make install</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>Lastly you need to include the tools in your path. You do this
      one of two ways depending on the UNIX shell you are using.</para>
      <para>For sh, ksh, bash, and the like, add the following lines to
      either the ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file.</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>PATH=[[installation location]]/bin:$PATH</member>
        <member>export PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>For csh or tcsh, add this line to the ~/.cshrc file:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>setenv PATH [[installation location]]/bin:$PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>For example, say you would like to install the tools in
      a folder called "asf_tools" in your home directory
      (/home/jdoe/asf_tools), and you use the bash UNIX shell</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>./configure --prefix=/home/jdoe/asf_tools</member>
        <member>make</member>
        <member>make install</member>
        <member>echo "PATH=/home/jdoe/asf_tools/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc</member>
        <member>echo "export PATH" >> ~/.bashrc</member>
      </simplelist>
