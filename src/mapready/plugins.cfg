# Plugins.cfg
# This file specifies 'external' tools that can be used within MapReady.
# Comment lines (starting with '#') and blank lines are ignored.
# The "Name" field:
#  - signals the start of the next tool definition, so it MUST appear FIRST
#  - is required
#  - is the text that appears in the drop-down selection list in MapReady.
# The Command" field:
#  - is required
#  - specifies how the external tool is run from the command-line
#  - needs to contain {Input} and {Output} where the input/outupt filenames go
#  - can optionally contain {Log} if a log file can be generated by the tool
#  - can optionally contain multiple user-specified parameters, which are
#    specified by $P1, $P2, $P3, etc.  These are replaced by MapReady with
#    values entered by the user, using the format specification.
# The "Comment" field:
#  - is optional
#  - will be displayed in MapReady just below the external tool drop-down
#    when the user selects this tool.
# The "P1", etc, fields:
#  - must be given AFTER the command string
#  - are required for each one given in the command string
#  - are a list of four values, separated by commas.
#    #1: the type of the field: double, integer, string
#    #2: "optional" or "required"
#    #3: C-style format string that indicates how the parameter appears
#        on the command line
#    #4: the label that will appear in MapReady where the user enters
#        the parameter's value
