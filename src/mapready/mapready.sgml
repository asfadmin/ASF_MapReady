        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>
            ASF MapReady is a program for converting SAR data into
            a GIS-ready image format (i.e., GeoTIFF).  Also, the SAR
            data can be geocoded, and/or terrain corrected.  Version
            2.0 (and later) versions
            of MapReady now supports SLC (single-look complex) SAR data,
            and for quad-pol SLC (i.e., ALOS/PALSAR Level 1.1) data, some
            polarimetric analysis is supported.

            This document only pertains to the ASF MapReady tool in its
            graphical user interface form.  For information on the command-
            line version of this and other common ASF command-line tools,
            please refer to the ASF MapReady User's Manual.  Other tools
            are documented separately and/or display help information by
            providing the -help flag (alone) on their command lines.

            The ASF MapReady tool performs the following functions, all
            of which are optional processing steps (other than import):

                    <para>
                        Imports a wide variety of satellite data formats into
                        ASF Internal Format.  Note: If the data is already is
                        already in ASF Internal Format, it is read directly
                        for processing.  Import processing includes the option
                        of processing to a particular radiometry selection
                        (Amplitude, Power, Sigma, Beta, or Gamma).  Import
                        options may be set on the Import tab.  ASF Internal
                        format consists of 2 files, a) a metadata file that
                        contains information about the data itself, and b)
                        a binary file which contains the pixels of data
                        themselves.  All processing by ASF tools other than
                        import require the data to be in  ASF Internal Format
                        file format.

                        Allows the user to select one of a few
                        standard polarimetric decompositions to
                        process quad-pol SLC (single-look complex)
                        data.  Currently, this means ALOS/Palsar
                        Level 1.1 data, though the Sinclair
                        decomposition can be done with quad-pol Palsar 1.5
                        data.  Using a polarimetric decomposition
                        is a technique used to visualize the great
                        deal of information contained in quad-pol
                        data with an RGB image.

                        Export processing transorms an ASF Internal Format
                        image (from importation or previous processing of
                        data) into graphics file formats such as JPEG, TIFF,
                        and GeoTIFF for greater compatibility with other GIS
                        and data-viewing programs.  Export options may be set
                        on the Export tab.  If no export is to be performed
                        then the result of the selected processing will be
                        in ASF Internal Format (see Data Import above.)  Note
                        that after exporting, a metadata (.meta) file will
                        remain.  The information in the metadata file
                        represents the data prior to export, i.e., before
                        remapping values to bytes etc ... which means
                        information such as data statistics may not be
                        valid for the exported file (but is valid for the
                        data prior to export).

            ASF MapReady was designed so that all pertinent settings are visible
            and available to the user for individual each processing step.  Each
            processing step has its own tab.  All settings and selections are available
            as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and drop-down list ...not buried or
            hidden in multi-level menus.

        <title>General Tab Options</title>

        <para>
            The General Tab is your starting point when using MapReady.  On this
            tab, you select which processing steps you wish to utilize and whether
            or not you wish to save all intermediate files.
        </para>

        <para>
            ASF MapReady is designed to be set up in a left-to-right order
            in the tabbed setup pages which appear in the graphical user
            interface.  In general, you will first want to select the list of
            processing steps that you would like to apply to your data
            (import, polarimetry, terrain correction, geocoding, and exporting) by checking
            the appropriate checkboxes on the General tab, then go to each
            individual tab to set up each individual processing step.  The graphical
            user interface will activate each tab which may require additional set
            up or selections based upon your processing step selections on the
            General tab.  If various processing steps are deselected on the General
            tab, then the associated set up tabs will be deactivated (greyed out.)
            Each tab is described in further detail below.
        </para>

        <para>
            The general tab also contains the "Keep Intermediate
            Files" options.  The processing flow creates a number
            of intermediate results for the various processing steps.
            For troubleshooting purposes or further analysis those
            intermediate results can be kept.  Examples include
            the imported data, layover and shadow masks
            automatically generated, imported versions of your DEM, clipped
            DEMs etcetera.  By saving the intermediate products, you can often
            troubleshoot your processing if you did not achieve your desired
            results.  Some intermediate products are viewable through
            MapReady with the "View Intermediates" right-click context
            menu in the Completed Files section, however not all of
            them are.  Those that aren't can be viewed with ASF View
            by selecting the file within ASF View.
        </para>
        <para>
            The "Temporarily keep intermediate files" option, the
            default, means that these intermediates are kept until
            you exit MapReady, or remove the processed product from
            the "Completed Files" section.  Keeping these
            intermediates around after processing is done allows you
            to look at these files, with the "View Intermediates"
            option in the right-click context menu for files in the
            Completed Files section.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you select the "Keep no intermediate files" option,
            the intermediate files are deleted as soon as processing
            completes.  (This was the default behavior in MapReady
            2.0.)  This means the "View Intermediates" menu in the
            Completed Files will not be available.  This option should
            be used if you are going to process a number of files, and
            are concerned about disk space, since the intermediate
            files can take up quite a bit of space.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you check the "Keep Intermediates" checkbox, all intermediate
            products developed during the processing of your data will be kept.
            Some will be in the same folder as your data, and some will be in a
            sub-folder (includes a time-stamp in the name of the folder for easier
            identification.)  
        </para>

        <para>Adding Files to the Input Files list:</para>

        <para>
            At this time, your data files must have the same basename as
            the metadata files associated with them.  You will not need to
            specify every file in a given granule -- just the data files.
            The meta-data files should be located in the same directory as
            the data file(s).
        </para>
        <para>
            For ALOS data, you should choose the leader file (starts
            with LED-), instead of choosing an individual band data
            file.
        </para>

        <para>There are several ways to add files to the Input Files list:</para>

                <para>
                    Files exist in data and metadata pairs.  The file you
                    should select is the data file (such as .D), and
                    not the metadata (such as .L).
                </para>
                <para>
                    For ALOS data, there is one metadata file (LED-*)
                    and one or more image files (IMG-*).  There is one
                    image (IMG-) file for each band in the input data.

        <title>Import Tab Options</title>
        <para>
            The Import checkbox is always checked on the General tab because
            'import' is always required.  Because it is always required, it is
            also greyed out so the user cannot deselect the Import step.  In
            the context of the ASF MapReady tools, the term "import" means
            "read the file from disk", regardless of format.  The reason that
            MapReady asks the user to specify the type of import is because
            certain other settings either apply, or don't apply, to particular
            types of data.  ASF MapReady attempts to prevent errors and the
            selection of non-applicable settings whenever possible.

        <para>
            MapReady 2.0 supports two polarimetric decompositions,
            Pauli and Sinclair.  The Pauli decomposition only works
            with quad-pol SLC (single-look complex) images.  (Only
            ALOS/Palsar currently supplies such imagery, it is
            Level 1.1 data.)  The Sinclair decomposition also requires
            quad-pol imagery but can be done on non-complex (Level
            1.5) data as well as SLC (Level 1.1) data.

            <para>Cloude-Pottier Classification</para>
            <para>
               The Cloude-Pottier classification scheme produces
               output with the data categorized into either 8 or
               16 classes.  The classification is based on three
               parameters which can be calculated from the 4-band
               complex data at each pixel.
            </para>
            <para>
               These parameters are calculated from the coherence
               matrix, which is calculated for each pixel.   These
               parameters are entropy, anisotropy, and alpha.
            </para>
            <para>
               Entropy is an indication of the degree of randomness in
               the scattering process.  Low entropy means there is a
               single dominant scattering mechanism in that pixel;
               high entropy means multiple scattering mechanisms are
               present in the pixel.
            </para>
            <para>
               Anisotropy represents the relative importance of the
               non-dominant scatterers.  When entropy is low, the
               anisotropy parameter means very little, but for high
               entropy it is a useful indication of the strength of
               the secondary scatters.
            </para>
            <para>
               Alpha can be used to identify what type of scatterer is
               the dominant one.  When alpha is close to 0,
               single-bounce scattering (e.g., a rough surface) is
               dominant.  For alpha near 90 degrees, the dominant scatterer
               is double-bounce.  Alphas in between these extremes
               represent a combination of both; at 45 degrees we have equal
               amounts of both which usually corresponds to volume
               scattering.
            </para>
            <para>
               The Cloude-Pottier parameters can be obtained directly
               (skipping the classification) by selecting the
               "Entropy, Anisotropy, Alpha" option.  This is the only
               option where you may assign RGB channels yourself, or
               choose to export three separate greyscale images (one
               for each of entropy, anisotropy, and alpha); with the
               other polarimetric decompositions the RGB channel
               assignment is determined by the decomposition

            <para>Freeman-Durden</para>
            <para>
               The Freeman-Durden decomposition is a model-based
               approach  it attempts to fit the combination of three
               simple scattering mechanisms to the polarimetric data.
               These mechanisms are (i) even- or double-bounce scatter
               from a pair of orthogonal surfaces with different
               dielectric constants, (ii) canopy scatter from a cloud
               of randomly oriented dipoles,  and (iii) Bragg scatter
               from a moderately rough surface.
            </para>
            <para>
               These three components are assigned to the three color
               channels during export: the double-bounce component (i)
               is assigned to the Red channel, the canopy component
               (ii) is assigned to the Green channel, and the rough
               surface component (iii) is assigned to the Blue channel.

            When the Polarimetry tab is active, the Export tab's
            RGB options changes to "Export RGB Image according to
            Polarimetric selection".  This means that the RGB
            channels in the final result are determined by the
            polarimetric decomposition.  The channels and how
            they are calculated from the input qual-pol data are
            listed next to the radio button on the Polarimetry
            tab for some of the decompositions.  For example, for
            Pauli the red channel is
            calculated by subtracting the complex VV-band value 
            from the complex HH-band value, and then determining
            the magnitude of the resulting complex value.

        <para>Faraday Rotation</para>
        <para>
            Atmospheric conditions are another condition which can
            affect the backscatter values, in addition to the
            scatterers on the ground.  This effect is called Faraday
            Rotation, and  usually this is an undesirable effect, the
            ground scatterers are the only contributions of interest.
            Turning this option on will attempt to correct the data
            for Faraday Rotation.  The method used to apply the
            correction requires quad-pol SLC data.
        </para>
        <para>
           The correction is done by estimating the rotation angle at
           each pixel, and then applying the correction using a
           smoothed rotation angle, or the average of all the rotation
           angles.
        </para>
        <para>
           If the rotation angle is small, you may wish to skip the
           correction.  If you specify a threshold angle, then the
           average Faraday Rotation angle is smaller (in absolute
           value) than the threshold, then the Faraday Rotation
           correction is skipped.  If you always want to apply the
           correction, then leave the box blank.

            If you check the Terrain Correction checkbox on the General
            Tab, then terrain correction processing will be enabled.  If
            you have a digital elevation model (DEM) available for the
            scene, you can use this DEM to refine the geolocation of the
            SAR data, or to perform terrain correction.
        </para>
        <para>
            Terrain correction necessarily involves geolocation refinement
            as well.  The terrain correction process alters the data in

            geometry of SAR.

        <para>
            Geolocation refinement doesn't affect the image data, however
            the image's metadata values are adjusted in order to improve

                    Some DEMs have holes in them; this is often
                    a problem with SRTM DEMs.  Holes are small spots or
                    areas in the image that have no height data in them (or a data
                    value that indicates 'no data'.)  If this is the case,
                    the terrain corrected product will often contain
                    streaks in the areas near the holes.  You can fill
                    the holes with values interpolated from the surrounding
                    terrain prior to terrain correction with this option.  Choosing
                    to fill DEM holes with interpolated values will
                    reduce or even eliminate these streaks. While this allows
                    the terrain surrounding the holes to be terrain corrected
                    properly, you should assume that the data within an

                    If you wish, you may use masking to improve geolocation

                    won't be necessary; in general, it is only necessary if
                    the scene contains large areas that won't correlate well
                    with the DEM.  For example, water bodies provide very poor

                    If you do not enter a pixel size, the pixel size in the input
                    SAR image will be retained -- unless the DEM image has a much
                    larger pixel size than the SAR image, in which case your SAR
                    image will be downsampled to have a pixel size of half that
                    of the DEM.  For example, if the SAR image has 12.5 meter pixels,
                    and the DEM has 60 meter pixels, the terrain correction processing
                    will downsample your SAR data to 30 meters.

                    60 meter pixels, and you specify a 12.5 meter pixel size, that
                    value will be used even though your terrain corrected result will

                    Radiometric terrain correction consists of normalising a SAR image
                    for well-understood variations in backscatter contributions from
                    the terrain slope.  For example, a hill facing towards the sensor
                    will produce might brighter returns than a backslope of the hill.
                    Since these slope values can be obtained from the DEM, the expected
                    backscatter can be adjusted to remove the impact of the slope.

            from the drop-down menu, additional data entry boxes will appear

            to the type you selected.

                    graphics file (if supported by the selected type.)  When
                    this option is turned on, floating point data is mapped into
                    byte (8-bits per pixel) format prior to producing the output
                    file.  Re-mapping methods are only available for floating
                    point data since byte data is already (somewhat obviously)
                    in byte format.

                <para>
                    At this time, floating point format is only available for
                    TIFF and GeoTIFF formats since the other graphics file formats
                    do not support floating point data.  Regardless, if remapping
                    is necessary or selected, you must select the algorithm which
                    will be used.  NOTE: If you prefer TIFF or GeoTIFF output, be
                    aware that many, if not most, viewing applications either
                    do not support floating point data or require additional
                    workaround steps in your workflow in order to utilize these
                    images.  Therefore, we generally recommend output in byte
                    format unless you have compelling reasons to do otherwise.

                            to output values according to a look-up table that
                            is developed from the integration of the
                            histogram bins that represent the image.  This
                            remapping method is nonlinear and may result in
                            some (very) minor shifts in the geolocations of
                            high-contrast boundaries within the image, i.e.
                            coastlines, ridge tops, etecetera.  Since histogram
                            equalization increases contrast in areas that have
                            low contrast within the image (mostly dark or light
                            regions) and decreases contrast in regions that
                            already had high contrast, its most useful application
                            is for making hard-to-detect details visible to the
                            observer.  Noting that only the most discriminating
                            users will be able to detect the minor shifts in some
                            of the geolocations within the image, it is good to

                <para>
                    Most GIS software packages have some troubles displaying or ingesting
                    GeoTIFFs that contain floating point data.  ASF MapReady is able to
                    produce (and ingest) floating point GeoTIFFs, but that doesn't mean
                    that it is a good idea to do so.  Some justifications for doing so
                    include the desire to maintain maximum accuracy of the data values
                    and minute differences in geolocations.  Choosing to resample to byte
                    output invariably changes the data range and in some cases, the
                    perceived locations of very small geographical features (sub-pixel)
                    as the data is remapped to the 0-255 data range.

                    If you are using ArcGIS (ArcMap) and seeing a pure black image when you
                    add a GeoTIFF as a raster data layer, it doesn't mean the data isn't there.
                    It's just not mapped to a displayable range of values, and that occurs
                    if ArcMap does not know what the range of data values are.  The 'fix' is to
                    let ArcMap determine and make use of the range of floating point values so
                    it can display the data properly:

                    (yet) add the floating point GeoTIFF to the data frame.  Next, from the
                    ArcToolbox run Data Management Tools->Raster->Calculate Statistics.  Browse
                    to your floating point GeoTIFF and click OK.  Now that ArcMap has calculated
                    the statistics for the file, you may add it to your data frame with the
                    usual Add Data button.

                    GeoTIFF's raster data layer name in the Layers tree and select Properties.
                    In the Properties dialog, click the Symbology tab.  In the Stretch section
                    of the Symbology tab (near bottom), select a type of stretch and click OK.
                    The data should display properly now.  Version 9.1 of ArcMap may sometimes
                    require calculation of the Histogram(s).
