    <title>The ASF SAR Training Processor</title>

    <title>Obtaining and Installing the Tool</title>
    <para>The latest ASF SAR Training Processor can be downloaded from
       the ASF web site, at http://www.asf.alaska.edu.  On that page,
       select the option to "Get SAR Tools".  This page lists all of
       the tools currently supported by ASF, and you'll see the SAR
       Training Processor (STP) listed there with a link to download
       the tool.  Before downloading, you'll be asked on which
       operating system you intend to run STP.
    </para>
    <para>How you install the tool depends on which operating system
       you selected.  Windows packages come with an installer, Linux
       packages come as an RPM, and Source packages contain source
       code with an autoconf-style configure script.</para>
    <sect1 id="Windows">
      <title>Windows Installation</title>
      <para>The Windows package contains just a single file, the
        installer.</para>
      <para>To install, you just need to open up the archive file that
        you downloaded (double-clicking on it will open it), and then
        run the installer program contained within.</para>
      <para>After installation, you will have a start-menu shortcut
        that you can use to run the SAR Training Processor.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="Linux">
      <title>Linux Installation</title>
      <para>To install the RPM, you need to have root access.  If you
        don't, you'll need to persurade your system administrator to
        install the package for you.  If that isn't feasible or you
        don't want to, you can instead download the Source package,
        and compile the tools yourself, where you can install them
        in your own home directory without requiring root
        privileges.</para>
      <para>To install the package: (Do this as root)</para>
      <simplelist><member>rpm -i stp-X.X.X.rpm</member></simplelist>
      <para>(Or course you need to replace the X's with whatever
        version you downloaded, for example: "rpm -i stp-1.0.13-1.rpm")
      </para>
      <para>After the package is installed, you can find out where it
        was put by using this rpm command, which does not require root
        access:</para>
      <simplelist><member>rpm -ql stp | grep stp</member></simplelist>
      <para>You should see something like the following:</para>
      <simplelist><member>/usr/local/bin/stp</member></simplelist>
      <para>which tells you that the package has been installed in
        /usr/local, which is the default.</para>
      <para>This directory needs to be added to your path, in order to
        run the tools.  Exactly how you do this depends on which UNIX
        shell you are using.</para>
      <para>For example, suppose you've installed the software in
        /opt/asf_tools.  For bash or the like, add these lines to your
        ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>export PATH=/opt/asf_tools/bin:$PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>For csh or the like, add this line to your ~/.cshrc
      file:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>setenv PATH /opt/asf_tools/bin:$PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>If you've gone with the default installation location of
        /usr/local, you may already have /usr/local/bin in your path,
        in which case you don't need to do anything.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="Source">
      <title>Source Installation</title>
      <para>After you've downloaded and extracted the archive, you
      need to compile the tools before they can be installed. To do
      this, make sure you're in the asf_tools directory, then:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>./configure --prefix=[[installation location]]</member>
        <member>make</member>
        <member>make install</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>You will need permissions to put files into
        [[installation location]]!  The default is /usr/local.</para>
      <para>For example, to install the tools in "asf_tools" folder of
        your home directory:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>./configure --prefix=~/asf_tools</member>
        <member>make</member>
        <member>make install</member>
      </simplelist>
    </sect1>
