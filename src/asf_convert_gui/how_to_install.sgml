    <title>Obtaining and Installing the Tool</title>
    <para>The latest version can be downloaded from
       the ASF web site, at http://www.asf.alaska.edu.  On that page,
       select the option to "Get SAR Tools".  You can then choose this
       tool from the list of tools currently distributed by ASF.
    </para>
    <para>How you install the tool depends on which operating system
       you are using. Windows packages come with an installer, Linux
       packages come as an RPM, and Source packages contain source
       code with an autoconf-style configure script.</para>

    <sect1 id="Windows">
      <title>Windows Installation</title>
      <para>The Windows package contains just a single file, the
        installer.</para>
      <para>To install, you open the archive file that
        you downloaded (double-clicking on it will open it); then
        run the installer program contained within.</para>
      <para>After installation, you will have a start-menu shortcut
        that you can use to run the tool.</para>
    </sect1>
    

    <sect1 id="Linux">
      <title>Linux Installation</title>
      <para>To install the RPM, you must have root access. If you
        do not, you will need your system administrator to
        install the package for you.  If that isn't feasible or you
        don't want to, you can instead download the Source package,
        and compile the tools yourself, where you can install them
        in your own home directory which does not require root
        privileges.</para>
      <para>To install the package:</para>
      <para>First extract the rpm from the archive:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>gunzip convert-X.X.X-linux.tar.gz</member>
        <member>tar xvf convert-X.X.X-linux.tar</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>Then, as root, install the rpm:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>rpm -i convert-X.X.X.rpm</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>(Of course you need to replace the X's with whatever
        version you downloaded, for example: "rpm -i convert-2.1.9.rpm")
      </para>
      <para>After the package is installed, you can find out where it
        was put by using this rpm command, which does not require root
        access:</para>
      <simplelist><member>rpm -ql stp | grep asf_convert</member></simplelist>
      <para>You should see something like the following:</para>
      <simplelist><member>/usr/local/bin/asf_convert</member></simplelist>
      <para>which tells you that the package has been installed in
        /usr/local, which is the default.</para>
      <para>This directory needs to be added to your path, in order to
        run the tools.  Exactly how you do this depends on which UNIX
        shell you are using.</para>
      <para>For example, suppose you've installed the software in
        /opt/asf_tools.  For sh, ksh, bash, or the like, add these lines to your
        ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>PATH=/opt/asf_tools/bin:$PATH</member>
        <member>export PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>For csh or tcsh, add this line to your ~/.cshrc file:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>setenv PATH /opt/asf_tools/bin:$PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>If you've gone with the default installation location of
        /usr/local, you may already have /usr/local/bin in your path,
        in which case you don't need to do anything.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Source">
      <title>Source Installation</title>
      <para>After you've downloaded and extracted the archive, you
      need to compile the tools before they can be installed. To do
      this, make sure you're in the asf_tools directory, then:</para>
      <para>First extract the directory tree from the archive:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>gunzip convert-X.X.X-src.tar.gz</member>
        <member>tar xvf convert-X.X.X-src.tar</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>Then build the tools. Please note that you will need
      permissions to put files into [[installation location]]! The
      default is /usr/local.</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>cd asf_tools</member>
        <member>./configure --prefix=[[installation location]]</member>
        <member>make</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>Next install them:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>make install</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>Lastly you need to include the tools in your path. You do this
      one of two ways depending on the UNIX shell you are using.</para>
      <para>For sh, ksh, bash, and the like, add the following lines to
      either the ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file.</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>PATH=[[installation location]]/bin:$PATH</member>
        <member>export PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>For csh or tcsh, add this line to your ~/.cshrc file:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>setenv PATH [[installation location]]/bin:$PATH</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>For example, say you would like to install the tools in
      a folder called "asf_tools" in your home directory
      (/home/jdoe/asf_tools), and you use the bourne (sh) UNIX shell</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>./configure --prefix=/home/jdoe/asf_tools</member>
        <member>make</member>
        <member>make install</member>
        <member>echo >> "PATH=/home/jdoe/asf_tools/bin:$PATH</member>
        <member>echo >> "export PATH"</member>
      </simplelist>
