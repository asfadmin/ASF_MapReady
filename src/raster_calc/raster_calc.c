NAME: raster_calc

SYNOPSIS:  raster_calc [-log <file>] <out.ext> "exp" <inA.ext> [<inB.ext> [...]]

DESCRIPTION:
	Calculates an output image based on some mathematical function of the
	input image (or images).  That is, if the expression is "2*a", the
	output image's pixel values will be twice the input image's pixel
	values. Works with any type of input data-- byte, short, long, or float.
