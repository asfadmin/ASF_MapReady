/*==================BEGIN ASF AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION==================*/
/*
ABOUT EDITING THIS DOCUMENTATION:
If you wish to edit the documentation for this program, you need to change the
following defines. For the short ones (like ASF_NAME_STRING) this is no big
deal. However, for some of the longer ones, such as ASF_COPYRIGHT_STRING, it
can be a daunting task to get all the newlines in correctly, etc. In order to
help you with this task, there is a tool, edit_man_header.pl. The tool *only*
works with this portion of the code, so fear not. It will scan in defines of
the format #define ASF_<something>_STRING between the two auto-generated
documentation markers, format them for a text editor, run that editor, allow
you to edit the text in a clean manner, and then automatically generate these
defines, formatted appropriately. The only warning is that any text between
those two markers and not part of one of those defines will not be preserved,
and that all of this auto-generated code will be at the top of the source
file. Save yourself the time and trouble, and use edit_man_header.pl. :)
