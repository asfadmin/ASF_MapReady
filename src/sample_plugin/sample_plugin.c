#include "asf_meta.h"

//
// This is a very simple program that illustrates how a person might write
// a "plugin" for the MapReady GUI.  (I.e., an item in the dropdown list on
// the "External" tab.)
//
// Hopefully there is enough here to serve as a starting point for writing
// your own tools that can be used by MapReady.  All plugins run after
// import, but before any additional processing starts (such as terrain
// correction or geocoding).
//
// This program just adds a given offset to all pixels in an image, producing
// an output image.  To add this to the GUI, you would need to modify the
// "plugins.cfg" file in the MapReady directory (mapready).  Add
// lines like the following:
//
// Name=Sample
// Command=sample_plugin -log {Log} -offset $P1 {Input} {Output}
// Comment=Adds the given offset to all pixels in the image.
// P1=double,required,"%f","Offset"
//
// This sample actually has the offset as optional, however there isn't
// much point in that (adds 0 to all pixels, leaving the output exactly
// the same as the input), so we can mark the offset value as required. 
//
