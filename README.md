To compile and install the tools, make sure you are in the "asf_tools"
directory (the same directory this file is in), then:

    ./configure --prefix=<<installation location>>
    make
    make install

You need permissions to put files into <<installation location>>!  The
default is /usr/local.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 1:  Install ASF tools into /usr/local/bin (and shared files in
            /usr/local/share/asf_tools) :

    ./configure
    make
    make install

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 2:  Install ASF tools to a folder "local" in your home directory:

    ./configure --prefix=~/local
    make
    make install

The following commands on the most recent Ubuntu should get you up
and running:

* sudo apt-get install git bison flex g++ gcc libgdal-dev libgtk2.0-dev libglade2-dev libgsl-dev libproj-dev libtiff-dev libgeotiff-dev shapelib libshp-dev libcunit1-dev fftw-dev
* git clone git@github.com/asfadmin/ASF_MapReady.git ASF_MapReady
* cd ASF_MapReady
* ./configure
* make

Optional:
* sudo make install

As noted above, if you skip the last step, add "/path/to/ASF_MapReady/bin" to your
PATH in ~/.bashrc.
