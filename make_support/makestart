#        The Zen and the Art of ASF STEP Makefiles:
#
#    Overview: a "makefile" is a sort of script which is
# read by the UNIX "make" utility.  The purpose of a 
# makefile is to quickly and automatically compile a 
# piece of software.  For the ASF STEP tools, there is 
# one makefile in each tool's directory, and one central 
# makefile (this file) in the asf_tools directory.  
#
#    The individual tools' makefiles "include" 
# make_support/system_rules to get the parameters they
# need (endian-ness, etc.)
#
#    If you're a user, your life is simple: always make 
# everything from the asf_tools directory, by typing:
#        make <toolname>
#
#    If you're an ASF programmer, however, since you're
# working on these tools, your life is (of course) 
# more complex.  When you modify a tool, you don't 
# need to change anything but that tool's makefile.  
# But if you add a tool, or change a tool's name, 
# you need to modify several other files, as well.
#
#    I (Orion Lawlor) have written a program which should
# make this process much easier for you.  It's in
# asf_tools/make_support/makemake, and it parses a file called
# asf_tools/make_support/master_program_list to generate the
# top-level makefile, as well as update our
# autotar directory.  To add a program or tool, just modify
# asf_tools/make_support/master_program_list, then run
# asf_tools/make_support/makemake.
#
#    To debug software, I suggest you make an alias like:
# alias Mag 'make OPTFLAG=-g'
# This will re-set the "OPTFLAG" variable to "-g" from "-O".
