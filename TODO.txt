ASF-STEP Lab Tools To-Do List: 6/21/1999
	Future modifications, additions, or improvements
to the SAR tools that I think could/should be made at some point.
These apply to all the SAR tools, and are things I (Orion Lawlor) 
didn't have time to get to before I left at the end of June, 1999.  
Difficulty levels vary from simple (a few days) to moderate 
(a week or so) to catastrophic (weeks or months) to truly
terrifying (months or years)


XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX INTERFEROMETRY XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-register_ccsd fails and calls register_cpx for CCSD
scenes that are shifted by more than about 1500 lines
in the azimuth direction.  Instead of AISP'ing two
huge chunks at the top and bottom of the scene,
it should call quicklook to estimate the single-pixel 
offset between the images, then AISP and fico very small pieces 
distributed all across the scene.  We'd need a new
calc_deltas and register_ccsd. [catastrophic]

-The software currently produces geocentric heights over
the ellipsoid-- it should produce geocentric heights over
the geoid.  Both corrections are small, but not negligible
height errors.

-deskew_dem and reskew_dem should use the actual SAR
equations to convert between ground and slant range,
instead of the first-order (linear) approximation they
now use.  They should also be able to handle different
ground and slant-range pixel sizes (right now, the
pixel sizes must be the same!). [moderate]

-in the same vein, demIFM calls create_dem_grid, which 
uses a serious hack to extract an appropriate ground-range
piece of the source DEM.  Create_dem_grid should actually
create a *grid* to map the DEM to a ground-range version
of the SAR (ideally, using fit_cubic instead of fit_plane),
instead of using two lines at the near and far range
like it does now. [simple]

-If you really got the above programs working, you could
just use create_dem_grid and deskew_dem to do "instant"
(sub-10 minute) terrain corrections.  Downside: you may
have to deskew the images beforehand and reskew afterwards.
[catastrophic]



XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX AISP XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-It seems like somebody aught to write a version of AISP that
somebody (anybody) can explain-- it's dangerous and unsatisfying
to use a processor whose equations we can't justify.  The
parts of AISP that would change would be the range migration
[equations to shift echo paths straight] and azimuth compression 
[equations to produce azimuth reference function] 
(rmpatch.c and acpatch.c). [truly terrifying]

-Similarly, somebody else aught to look into Secondary Range
Migration (I've calculated Ke in section 4.2.54 of Curlander's
SAR book, but the new value is very close to the old value and
makes no difference in the image's focus). [moderate]

-JERS is not quite focused-- the geolocations are excellent with
the current slant range; but AISP seems to need about a 10km larger
slant range to get a really tightly focused image. [catastrophic]

-dop_prf has potential, but needs some serious work.  It needs to
use a larger test window, try multiple locations, or else use
quicklook's output to try to find contrasty places.  It could
also only do one range compression and azimuth FFT-- only 
range migration and azimuth compression depend on the doppler.

-I don't believe "deskew" and AISP's deskew option work properly.
The basic problem is that zero doppler and zero yaw don't 
actually lie at the same location, because the Earth rotates
(even though JPL doesn't seem to believe this!).  Deskewed
images are a farce anyway, in my opinion. (I believe in time/
slant/doppler images, and map-projected images.  Anything else
is a shameful, illegitemate union of the two.)  If you think
otherwise, write a "deskew" and geolocation algorithm that 
produces results consistent with slant-range, non-deskewed
geolocations. [catastrophic?]



XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX LIBRARY CHANGES XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-asf_meta's get_ceos.c routines should look through
files with .ldr, .trl, .tlr, .L, .dat, .raw, and .D 
extentions for every CEOS record they're looking for--
other facilities (and the LZP) put records in random,
unpredictable places.  ceos2raw hacks around this 
limitation by soft-linking the .raw file to a .D file
just so it can get_ifiledr!  This is very ugly.
[moderate]

-asf_meta's ceosIO.c routines should deal with multi-banded
CEOS SAR images, but they don't.  Also, all the tools should
deal with multi-banded SAR images of any data type (use
getFloatLine_mb and putFloatLine_mb *everywhere*).  We'll
really need this once we start doing multitemporal analysis
or have multispectral/multipolarization sensors.
[catastrophic]

-asf_meta's "getTimeSlantDop" routines for geocoded
ScanSAR image ignore the image doppler (the ASF doppler
values give bizarre results).  Somebody needs to figure
out why this is. [moderate]

-I think .ddr files should be in all-ASCII format, instead 
of the current ugly LAS mixed ASCII/binary format.  This is 
easier than it sounds-- DDR structures are always read/written 
by the "c_getddr" and "c_putddr" routines in our asf_las library.
A more useful (and more ambitious) project would be to fold
the .meta and .ddr files into a single ASCII file (named
.ddr, probably).  Of course, we'd have to be able to read
the old format for a while (maybe only in a convert_ddr 
program) and would have to finally give up on the EDC LAS 
package (this would be tough on Rick, but I think it'd be good
in the long run-- users *don't* have LAS!). [catastrophic]



XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX OTHER TOOLS XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-Somebody needs to get cygwin and really test out the
Win32 binaries (ideally, on Win95, 98, as well as NT).
I've poked around with the tools a bit, but haven't
even tried most programs. [moderate]

-remap needs to have a "-pixelsize" option, which would
scale the image to the given pixel size and set the resampling
kernel appropriately.

-geocode may need to use a higher-order polynomial 
(right now it's a planar cubic equation) or some other
function to do the resampling.  This means changing 
fit_cubic to fit some other function, and adding another
option to remap to handle the function.  I'm not convinced
a least-squares fit is even appropriate here-- the
geocoded points probably have less than 1/10'th pixel
of error, and the errors certainly aren't random.
[moderate]

-display_pdr and get_names may not work properly on little-
endian systems.  asf_meta and asf_las use the "asf_endian.h" 
functions and macros to work properly on any integer size/
endian system.  The tools also need be checked for 64/128-bit
integer compliance.  Basically, all you need to do is *always*
use the "sizeof" macros to figure out how much memory to allocate,
and *never* read directly from disk into an "int", "short", or
"long" (instead, read an array of "unsigned char" and convert
them to a 16- or 32- bit quantity).  [moderate]

-Along the same vein, *all* the tools should use the
"getFloatLine_mb" and "putFloatLine_mb" asf_las calls-- these handle
all data types, integer/float size problems, and endian differences
automatically.  Tom's tools (which assume byte amplitude and
short DEM images) and the interferometry tools (which assume
float images) are especially guilty of this. [moderate]

-It seems like there should only be *one* concat in existence.
"concat" and "concatm" are substantially identical, far-too-
complicated LAS tools, and "concat_dem" is a bare-bones
interferometry tool. [moderate]

-dump_multi_volume is way too complicated for a shell script.
It needs to be re-written in C, incorporating get_names and
check_name_of along the way.  Somebody with a PC IDE 8mm tape
drive should try to write a version which works under Win32, 
as well. [catastrophic]

-the ASAP portion of propagate (our very accurate state 
vector propagator) needs to be re-written in C (it's currently
in Fortran).  [truly terrifying]
