    NAME: aisp - ASF Sar Processor (SAR Software Correlator)

    SYNOPSIS:     aisp [options] ifile ofile

              ifile   input ASF CCSD (.D & .L), or raw file (.raw & .in)
                      of raw SAR signal data.
              ofile   output file name.  AISP will create ofile_amp.img,
                      a multilooked amplitude image, and ofile.cpx, a 
                      single-look-complex image.

    DESCRIPTION:
        This program creates a complex SAR image from ASF signal data.
     Either the input AND output file names or a parameter file name
     must be specified.  The input file (ifile) must be an ASF groundstation
     CCSD product pair (ifile.D & ifile.L).  The standard outputs are:

      - ofile.cpx       Single-look-complex float SAR image 
      - ofile.meta      Meta data file for output image
      - ofile.in        Parameter file that was used for this run
      - ofile.meta      Metadata file containing state vectors, etc.
      - ofile_amp.img   Multilooked float SAR amplitude image.
      - ofile_amp.meta  Meta data file for amplitude image.

     Basically put, ASP works in one of two modes,

         A - Input parameters are read from an image's CEOS metadata (.L)
      or B - Input parameters are read from a parameter file (.in)

     In mode A (the default), the file <ifile>.L is interrogated to fill the
     platform and scene dependent parameters necessary to define a valid run.
     In mode B (when reading raw signal data), a previously generated 
     parameter file, <ifile>.in, is used to fill these processing parameters.
     When many runs are to be performed on a single input scene or if the image
     metadata is known to be erroneous, it is more convenient to use mode B.
    
    OPTIONS:

      The following switches provide the ability to override 1) default values,
     2) parameters read from metadata, and 3) parameters read from a previously
     generated parameter file.
 
    SWITCH	   DEF   DESCRIPTION
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -l first_line   0    First line to read (from 0).  This parameter controls
			 the first line of data read from the input CCSD file.
			 The default is 1 to automatically skip the CEOS leader
			 record occurring as the first line of every ASF CCSD
			 file.  (Using a value of 0 is invalid for ASF data.)

    -p #patches     8    This parameter controls the number of patches that
                         will be processed.  For each patch, 4K lines are read
                         from the input file and a default of 3000 valid output
                         lines are created (see -v below).

    -v valid_lines 3000  Valid output lines per patch.  This parameter controls
			 the number of Azimuth lines that are considered valid
                         for each 4K patch of lines processed.  For each patch,
                         valid_lines lines of data are written as output.

    -s skip_samps   0    This sets the number of samples in each line that are
                         to be treated as INVALID.  Thus, 2*skip_samps bytes
                         from the begining of each line are completely ignored.
			 Internally, the record leader for each line (again,
                         standard with ASF data) is automatically skipped.  The
                         -s switch allows for extra i,q samples to be skipped
                         in a similar fashion.

    -f first_samp    0   First range sample to use (from 0).  This parameter
                         controls the first range sample to be processed in
                         each line.  This switch differs from -s by specifying
			 the number of VALID range samples to skip, while -s
			 specifies how many INVALID samples are skipped.  When
			 using the -f switch, the range to the first pixel is
			 adjusted appropriately.  
    -e 1            0    Remove doppler skew from image flag.  If -e 1 is given,
                         the image will be moved to zero doppler (deskewed).
                         The default is to output the image at the processed doppler.

    -n num_samps   META  The number of range samples to process.  By default,
                         all range samples in the file are used.  (This
                         parameter is normally read from metadata.)

    -r output_res   8.0  Desired output azimuth resolution (m).  Theoretical
			 best resolution is ~5.0 meters for ERS-1 data.

    -d debug_flag    1   Debug flag;  Turns on the creation of different debug
			 files.  The flags can all work together simply by 
			 adding their values.

			  1 = create a multilooked amplitude image
				ofile_amp.img	multilooked float amplitude file

			  2 = create range reference function files
				reference_time 	  time domain
				reference_freq    phase domain

			  4 = create a range migrated test file
				rangemig.cpx      range migrated float complex
						  data (1st patch only)
				
                          8 = create a range compressed test file
 			        rangecomp.cpx     range compressed
				                  float complex data (1st patch)
				rangefft.cpx      range compressed,
						  azimuth transformed
						  float complex data (1st patch)

			 16 = create azimuth reference functions
			 	az_time.cpx	time domain
			 	az_fft.cpx	phase domain

    -c dfile         NO  Read doppler centroid from dfile.  This switch 
			 disables the doppler centroid estimation and enables
			 reading the doppler centroid constant from a file.
			 The file should contain a 3 floating point numbers
			 that represents the constant, linear, and quadratic
			 doppler terms as a percentage of the PRF.

    -o off_file      NO  Read image offsets from off_file.  This switch allows
                         for patch offsets to be read from file.  The file
                         should contain 8 floating point numbers which represent
                         (in order):

			  sloper,interr    Slope and intercept for range	
			  slopea,intera    Slope and intercept for azimuth
			  dsloper,dinterr  Delta slope, intercept for range
			  dslopea,dintera  Delta slope, intercept for azimuth

                         All values should be in terms of pixels, including the
                         deltas.  The slope is an odd parameter-- it always depends 
                         on the range pixel (x).  This is because the slope,
			 intercept parameters are used as
				xOut = x - sloper*x - interr.
				yOut = y - slopea*x - intera.
			 
			 This way, the default is for all these parameters to be zero.
			 slopea is multiplied by x because the azimuth reference
			 function is constructed for an entire azimuth line-- so
			 no Y scaling is possible.

     -h 1            NO  Use a Hamming window instead of a rectangular one
                         for the azimuth reference function weighting

     -m CAL_PARAMS   NO  Read the Elevation Angle and Gain vectors from the
                         CAL_PARAMS file to correct for the antenna gain

     -x logfile      NO  Allows output to be written to a log file. With this switch
			 the user can store all the relevant information in a log
			 file while analyzing the progress on screen.

     -q 1            NO  Suppresses the output to the essential. This switch skips all
			 information that is only needed for troubleshooting and
			 debugging.

     -a 1	     NO  Creates power (magnitude) image.

    EXAMPLES:

      ex1>  aisp -v 3000 -n 5000 E122361290S0C014 e1

        Process the CCSD file E122361290S0C014.D into complex image e1.cpx,
      and e1_amp.img.  Processing proceeds by running 8 image patches
      of size 4096 lines (azimuth) by 5000 samples (range), creating 24,000
      lines (8 patches * 3,000 valid lines per patch) of 5,000 samples of
      float complex image data.  e1_amp.img will be 4800 lines (8 patches
      * 3000/5 lines per patch) by 5000 samples of float data.  Note that the
      combined output requires 24000*5000*8 + 4800*5000*4 = 1,056 Megs of disk
      space for this run.  This command takes about an hour to run.

      ex2>  aisp -p 1 -l 20000 -f 1000 -n 290 -v 300 E122361290S0C014 e1

	This example processes the same input data as above, but only extracts
      a tiny piece starting at line 20,000 and sample 1,000.  A 290x300 output
      complex image e1.cpx will be created, as well as e1_amp.img, a multilooked
      290x60 float amplitude image.  This example takes about 1 minute to run.

    FILE FORMATS:
    	The input files can be ASF-format CCSD data, or any byte-aligned file
    format.  For CCSD data, AISP automatically determines the size and 
    characteristics of the file.  
    
    
	AISP can also process a common, simple, generic format: each sample of
    SAR data is encoded as two bytes, containing the real and imaginary (I and Q)
    components of the echo as unsigned bytes.  AISP then expects to find a file with
    the same base name as the input file, but with extention ".fmt", containing:
    	
    .fmt file:
    	<number of bytes per line of data> <number of header bytes per line>
    	<mean value of I samples> <mean value of Q samples>
    	<byte order in file: 'n'=i,q; 'y'=q,i>
    	[<ignored line>]
    	[<line1> <window shift (pixels)> <agc scale>]
    	[<line2> <window shift (pixels)> <agc scale>]
    	[...]
    
    .fmt example:
    	11232 0                 ! Bytes per line, bytes per header.
	15.500000 15.500000     ! i,q bias
	y                       ! Flip i/q?
	
	While constructing a .fmt file, it may be useful to use the signal2amp
    or spectra SAR processing debugging programs.



	AISP can also read in a range pulse replica (chirp), or generate
    a linear FM pulse replica.  If AISP finds a file with the same base name 
    as the input file, but with extention ".replica", containing:
    
    .replica file:
    	<number of samples>
    	<real part, sample 1> <imaginary part, sample 1>
    	<real part, sample 2> <imaginary part, sample 2>
    	...
    .replica example:
    	1440
    	0.0 -1.0
    	1.2 0.3
    	...

       then AISP will use this range pulse replica to compress the data.  
     Otherwise, it will synthesize a linear FM chirp.


    HARDWARE/SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS:

	This program requires large amounts of memory to run.  The main
    buffer is 
	      size(trans) = n_az * n_range * sizeof(complexFloat)

              where  n_az = number of lines in a patch (azimuth samples)
		     n_range = number of lines in the azimuth (range samples) 

    n_az is defined is aisp_def.h as 4096, and a full swath of ERS CCSD
    data includes 5616 range samples, so size(trans) = 176 Mbytes.  When 
    this is combined with the rest of the storage requirements for the
    program, 200+ Mbytes are needed.

    Because of the 1000+ azimuth lines of overhead per patch, it is best
    NOT to decrease the defined value of n_az.  Rather, one should decrease
    n_range by processing fewer range bins at a time.  Regardless, n_az should
    always be a power of 2 because the FFTs operate best that way.
