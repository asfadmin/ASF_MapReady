Bugs Fixed
- When using "Save Clipped DEM" with terrain correction, the saved
  DEM was not always clipped properly.
- MapReady would crash on Windows Vista.
- MapReady's "Help" option would not work on Windows Vista.

  when using the "Browse" button on the "Destination Folder" dialog,
  instead of the Windows one.  Allows creating directories within
  the widget, and can be set to start up in the current directory.

  by adding an amplitude band that is used only for coregistration.
- Include processing settings and timing information in the MapReady
  log file.

  downsampling.
- Improved ASF View's depiction of RGB images by using separate
  constrast expansion on all three bands, instead of a single mapping
  for all three.
- Pixel averaging in ASF View when zoomed out.  (Results in a less
  grainy image.)

  supported for 1.0.
- MapReady: Error out gracefully (instead of crashing) when trying to
  terrain correct with DEMs in the Lat/Lon pseudoprojection.

  certain CDPF data
- Configure script improved so that if GTK libraries are not available,
  it is made very clear that the applications with graphical user
  interfaces will not be built

MapReady 1.0.2 (released 2008 January 2)
New Functionality (GUI and command-line tools)
- Convert GUI name changed to MapReady and redesigned and reorganized
  the user interface for more intuitive use, advanced tool tips,
  improved help.  Command line version, asf_convert, renamed to
  asf_mapready.
- New tool! Added new SAR and Optical image viewer (asf_view).
  Replaces, modernizes, and enhances capabilities previously found
  in the now-unsupported sarview tool, allows viewing geographic
  region covered by the dataset in Google Earth, and applies
  pseudo-color according to look-up tables available from a drop-down
  list.
- New tool! Added shift_geolocation (command line) to the tool set.
  Allows manual shifting of geolocation if a known offset exists.
  Similar to refine_geolocation but no DEM is required.
- New tool! Added Projection Coordinate Converter (GUI) to the tool
  set.  This tools converts projection coordinates in one map
  projection into projection coordinates in another map projection.
  The GUI allows you to specify map projection parameters, manually
  enter coordinates, or select a file that contains coordinate
  triplets (x, y, height) - one triplet per line.  Results can be
  saved to a file as well.
- New tool!  Added 'trim', a simple command-line utility that
  facilitates subsetting an ASF Internal Format file given
  starting line, number of lines, starting sample, and number of
  samples.
- New tool!  Added 'fill_holes', a tool that replaces values in an
  image below a given cut-off with values interpolated from the
  shape and height of the surrounding terrain.  The fill_holes tool
  is handy for manually patching 'holes' (regions with no-data values,
  typically very small negative values) in DEMs prior to using the
  DEM for terrain correction.  The result is that hole-related
  artifacts in terrain corrected images are minimized (available
  as a command-line flag to asf_mapready and as a checkbox in MapReady
  as well.)
- New tool!  The 'to_sr' tool has been added to the tool suite.  The
  to_sr tool converts a ground range (or map-projected ASF Internal
  format image with state vectors available in the metadata file)
  into a slant-range image.  Replaces deprecated gr2sr tool.
- New tool!  The 'deskew' tool has been added to the tool suite.  The
  deskew too removes satellite platform squint-induced skew from
  ground range images.

- Enhanced TIFF/GeoTIFF ingest to support a much broader spectrum of
  GeoTIFF types (scanline, tiled, striped, color; geocentric lat/long
  in decimal degrees)
- Added support for several new CEOS data formats (BEIJING ESA raw,
  CDPF)
- Terrain correction of ScanSAR and ALOS Palsar
- Sinclair decomposition upon export for real-valued radar images
- Added 'Display in Google Earth' buttons to the GUI for viewing of
  the data extents in the Google Earth (tm) program.
- Added ability to patch 'holes' (interpolate over missing data)
  in DEMs.  Also see new tool 'fill_holes'.
- Ability to export PNG graphics file format

  utilizing the Hughes reference spheroid

  exporting individual bands from multi-band files
- Improved JPEG output (reduced JPEG artifacts)

  some dependencies on the name of the file (less error prone)

  conventions
- Added support for bicubic resampling during geocoding of byte
  images

ASF Convert 2.0.1 (released 2005 April 28)
The ASF software tools are designed to make it easier for users to process ASF
data products and translate them into a variety of other formats. A graphical
user interface exists which guides the user through the process of ingesting,
geocoding, and exporting datasets.

The tools can currently ingest most Level 1 ASF products, and produce geocoded
(or non-geocoded) GeoTIFF, TIFF, JPEG, or portable pixmap images. The GUI that
runs on the windows environment has 4 different tabs which allows the user to
import, export, geocode to apply one of four projections and to modify how the
radiometry is displayed.
