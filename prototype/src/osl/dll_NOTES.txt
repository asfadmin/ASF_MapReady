LINUX:

Build a shared library by compiling with "-shared":

MUST pass a path & extension (e.g., "./foo.so") to dlopen;
just plain "foo.so" doesn't work (searches LD_LIBRARY_PATH),
and just "./foo" doesn't work (no extension).

gcc -shared test_dll_server.cpp -o foo/test_server.so
g++ test_dll.cpp -I. -ldl && ./a.out

Checking everything in LD_LIBRARY_PATH (loading, doing 
a single ldsym) takes about half a second!

Need a "__declspec(dllexport)" before the routine
return type, or the routine name *isn't* exported.  Grrr.
Can also write a ".def" file that lists:
	LIBRARY <foo>.dll
	EXPORTS
	<routine name>
	<routine name>


Idea: find symbols with either
	nm test_dll_sub.obj
or Microsoft
	dumpbin /SYMBOLS test_dll_sub.obj

Now write a .def file containing all symbols.

CANNOT pass ./ as a path to dlopen.  But "foo/bar.dll" is OK.
CANNOT access symbols in "main", even with /link /FORCE:UNRESOLVED

Compile with
	cl /I. /DWIN32=1 osl/test_dll_sub.cpp /LD
	cl /I. /DWIN32=1 osl/test_dll_server.cpp /LD test_dll_sub.lib
	cl /I. /DWIN32=1 osl/test_dll.cpp

MacOS X:
MacOS 10.3 and on have dlopen; earlier versions are stuck
with "NSAddImage".
gcc -dynamiclib test_dll_server.cpp -o foo/test_server.so
