Debugging log, ASF Tile prototype


------------------ 2006/01/29
Working:
	- Single tile
Backwards but non-crashing:
	- One row of tiles--meta coordinates seem backwards
Crashing
	- Multiple rows of tiles

image_testpattern w=256 h=64 type=3 scale=100.0 value=10.0;
image_clamp min=0.5 max=5.0 src=@image_testpattern.dest;
image_output_binary 
	src=@image_clamp.dest 
	filename="image_clamp_row.test.img";

For some reason, image_clamp doesn't do tiles; but
image_testpattern does.

gdb ../clui/clui
break main
r -v100 image_clamp_row.test
break execute_plugin::render
c
c
	-> Fixed pixel_viewport from and to (were switched).
	   Now everything (tile, row, image) appears to work!

Non-round row files currently crash:

image_testpattern w=600 h=80 type=3 scale=100.0 value=10.0;
image_clamp min=3.0 max=5.0 src=@image_testpattern.dest;
image_output_binary 
	src=@image_clamp.dest 
	filename="image_clamp.test.img";

FATAL ERROR: asf::parameter_pixel_image::pixel_setsize asked to access pixels not inside our meta bounds!

(cd ..;make clui/clui) && ../clui/clui -v10 image_clamp.test ; sarview image_clamp.test.img

OK.  Just needed more rectangle intersections.  Now 
arbitrary image sizes work!

For the Windows port, I have to move everything needed by the plugins
into a plugin itself.  Since there's no equivalent of RTLD_GLOBAL for Windows;
a DLL can only depend on other DLLs, *not* on an EXE.

This complicates the situation on UNIX, since the clui binary has to 
find asf_core.dll, and then asf_core.dll loads the plugins.
On Linux, soname allows you to avoid having to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
but you've now got to set *BOTH* LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or worse, LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH
on IRIX) and ASF_LIBRARY_PATH, which is silly and redundant.

If an environment variable is needed, it should be LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
This might make it easier to define a plugin that depends on other
plugins.

-----------------------------
Windows shared libraries:
	- Gotta have asf_core.dll in same directory as clui.exe.

Under WINE:
MUST use a relative path for ASF_LIBRARY_PATH, or get "dll open failed" (?),
which results in "no such plugin 'system'" errors.

export ASF_LIBRARY_PATH="../lib"
../bin/clui.exe -- -v10 -l image_clamp_lil.test
  -> works fine!

But still dies in echo test-- seems to be something about RTTI.  

OK-- fixed.  Gotta compile with the /GR flag to get RTTI info, or any code that calls RTTI will just segfault.  Weird.

Added DDR I/O and image_input_las module.

Seems to be exactly 2x zoomed-out: I only get valid pixels at X's:

X  n  X  n
n  n  n  n 
X  n  X  n
n  n  n  n 

OK--zoom seems to be getting inexplicably set to 1,
somewhere between execute_image::render and execute_plugin::render:
image_input_las: execute_image> image render  region(rect (0-67, 0-64), zoom 0)
image_input_las: execute_image> image allocated with (67,64) meta pixels
image_input_las: execute_plugin> render {   region(rect (0-67, 0-64), zoom 1)

Looking closer, "zoom" might not ever be initialized.  Checking valgrind:

valgrind ../bin/clui image_input_las.test 

==29551== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==29551==    at 0x409E7BB: plugin_image_clamp::execute() (image_clamp.cpp:30)
==29551==    by 0x406ABCC: execute_plugin::render(render_request const&) (plugin_execute.cpp:644)

Yup!  Uninitialized data.

One silly fix is just to set zoom in execute_image constructor.
Wait--this doesn't fix it.  OK-- got it.  Scanline constraint had
a bug where "oz" was a *scaling* (and hence 1), not the new weird 
log-base-2 thing (and hence 0). Fixed.  Now valgrind runs clean.

-------------------------
2006/06/06:

Added an image checksum plugin, to actually test out cross-platform stuff.

Sadly, it's not actually running--
	textfile_out (the sink) does a non-image run, and asks its inputs.
	image_checksum does a render, but immediately (incorrectly) returns.

This looks like another plugin_execute bug.  OK-- problem seems to be the big request rectangle passed by non-image plugins.  Specifically, calling
	rect_tiling tiles(req.rect,p->tile);
with a wide-open rectangle gives *zero* tiles, which is wrong.

OK.  Fixed--add more rectangle intersections in execute_plugin::render:
	pixel_rectangle rect=req.rect.getIntersect(ei->Aimg->total_meta_bounds());

That is, we just need to clip down requests to the area we actually cover.

--------------------------
2006/06/07:

Trying to get JPEG output working.  I don't know what order the routines are supposed to be called in.

crap_bad_init.dll> Loaded plugin
Bogus input colorspace

Ah.  You get this error message if you incorrectly set "num_components" instead of "input_components".  Fixed.  Can now read and write JPEG images with libjpeg.

--------------------------
2006/07/06:
The thing seems to work in Windows, which is pretty cool.  I'm getting some weird error from wine while trying to *write* files: Access denied.  I'll have to try this in real Windows.

With the Intel compiler icc, I'm getting an error from checksum:

------------------ Test: image_blur.test -------------------
  image_blur.test passed test (compare to good output)
------------------ Test: image_checksum.test -------------------
