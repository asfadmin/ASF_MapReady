First suprise: checksumming with image_checksum is actually 3x
*slower* than just outputting an image--3MPix/s rather than about 10MPix/s.

Second suprise: you can call "execute" with 1 *pixel* images, and it ain't much slower than huge tiles.  Ah--this is just an artifact of using single 

Stupid language bug:
image_clamp min=1.2 max=9.8 in=@image_input_las.out;
image_clamp mul=2.2 add=0.8 in=@image_clamp.out;
The second clamp actually tries to read from its *own* output, rather than the *previous* call's output.  This is caused by the "for scoping" bug fix.

Here's the 1-megapixel image results:

-> Input or output costs 50ns/pixel.  That's huge.

-> Each additional plugin pass costs about 14ns/pixel.  That's still pretty big--way bigger than like an SSE instruction (1-2ns), or a GPU instruction.


-- Why's I/O so slow? --
50ns/pixel is 20 million pixels per second.  Pixels are 4-byte floats.  That's 80MB/s, which is pretty fast for user/kernel communication.


-- Why's computation so slow? --
objdump --disassemble lib/image_clamp.cpp.dll
objdump --disassemble lib/image_fma.cpp.dll
Shows no subroutine calls for a simple "read, process, write" pixel loop.  Excellent!  I figured there'd be at least a few non-inlined subroutine calls.

That's a heck of a lot of imul's: 4 of them--2 each in x and y.  This is needed because the compiler's scared of "xd" and "yd" changing during a run, and hence won't incrementalize them.  Maybe it'd be cheaper to require continuous per-band image storage, which would fix xd==1 and additionally possibly allow the compiler to induct away the yd multiplications.  This would mean giving up on band-interleaved images internally, however, which might be too big a price to pay.

Some sort of super-badass SSE-capable code generator would be the ideal thing here--it'd be able to get rid of everything but the "fmuls/fadd" above, by fusing together the arithmetic across a whole set of plugins.  It'd just be nasty, however, to write the plugins like this--you'd have to somehow abstractly define what you want done to the input pixels.  Perhaps a wacko-C++ trick like the "lambda" class, or "Sh" metaprogramming might help here...
